        <p>Aston Martin's vision is to be the world’s most desirable, ultra-luxury British brand, creating the most exquisitely addictive performance cars.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford, Aston Martin is acknowledged as an iconic global brand synonymous with style, luxury, performance, and exclusivity. Aston Martin fuses the latest technology, time honoured craftsmanship and beautiful styling to produce a range of critically acclaimed luxury models including the Vantage, DB11, DBS and DBX and its first hypercar, the Aston Martin Valkyrie.</p>

        <p>Based in Gaydon, England, Aston Martin Lagonda designs, creates and exports cars which are sold in 55 countries around the world. Its sports cars are manufactured in Gaydon with its luxury DBX SUV range proudly manufactured in St Athan, Wales.</p>

        <p>Lagonda was founded in 1899 and Aston Martin in 1913. The two brands came together in 1947 when both were purchased by the late Sir David Brown, and the company is now listed on the London Stock Exchange as Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc.</p>

        <p>2020 saw Lawrence Stroll become the company’s Executive Chairman, alongside significant new investment, a move that led to Aston Martin’s return to the pinnacle of motorsport with the Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One™ Team and commenced new era for the iconic British marque.</p>
